Alan++ Compiler in Swift
========================

#Important
This project has been updated to use [Swift 1.2](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=22) which is not backwards compatible with previous versions. Make sure that you have [Xcode 6.3 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) installed. Sorry for the inconvience.

This is a compiler for CMPT432 written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). It will eventually compile `Alan++` into [6502 opcode](http://www.6502.org/tutorials/6502opcodes.html).

- [Xcode 6.3 (or higher)](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [OS X 10.10 (or higher)](https://www.apple.com/osx/)
